# FewBit NetworK - Balances self-governance between SmartNodes, Staking System and Miners.

FewBit operates on a system of self-governance, where stakeholders including stakers, token holders, Service Node operators, and others vested in the blockchain can collectively make decisions.

FewBit harnesses the capabilities of a network consisting of Service Nodes and Staking Nodes. Service Nodes provide the computational power necessary for all FewBit functions, while Staking Nodes safeguard the network through our smartnodes system.

FewBit is community-governed and operates without a centralized entity, ensuring that decisions are made by and for the community. The project sustains its development through a self-funding mechanism.

## Enhancing GhostRider
Building upon the innovative groundwork laid by Raptoreum, FewBit is poised to broaden its horizons, venturing into dynamic sectors such as GameFi and Ecommerce. From the very beginning, we have upheld a commitment to decentralization by refraining from pre-mining FBIT. This principle underscores our dedication to a governance model driven by the community. To sustain our development efforts, 5% of each mined block is allocated to the FewBit team, ensuring continuous growth and innovation.
